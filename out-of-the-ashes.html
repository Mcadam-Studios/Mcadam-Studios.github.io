            <h1>Out of the Ashes</h1>
            <p class="lead">
                A grounded post-collapse story universe about family, leadership under pressure, and the brutal maths of survival —
                where the most dangerous thing isn’t the wasteland, it’s what people become when the rules vanish.

                <h2>Logline</h2>
                <p>
                    After government greed and human negligence fracture society, a father and his two children fight through a collapsing
                    Britain toward the promised safety of the Green Zone — but survival demands choices that threaten to break the family
                    long before the world does.

                <h2>What It Feels Like</h2>
                <p>
                    Real roads. Real hunger. Real fear. The apocalypse isn’t a fireworks show — it’s quiet systems failing, one service at a time,
                    until the only law left is the one you can enforce. The tone stays human: tense, emotional, occasionally darkly funny.

                <p>
                    • Leadership under pressure<br />
                    • Family as the last institution<br />
                    • Hope with a price tag<br />
                    • Moral trade-offs and consequence<br />
                    • The danger of “safe zones” and false promises

                <h2>The Hook</h2>
                <p>
                    Out of the Ashes isn’t about zombies or spectacle — it’s about what collapses inside people when the outside world collapses.
                    The biggest threat is rarely a monster. It’s a desperate human with a plan.

                <h2>Main Characters</h2>
                <p>
                    <strong>Callum</strong> — a fiercely devoted father trying to keep his children alive, even when it costs him his own humanity.<br /><br />
                    <strong>Lucy (7)</strong> — brave, fierce, and stubbornly hopeful; a daddy’s girl who refuses to be treated like a passenger.<br /><br />
                    <strong>Thomas (4)</strong> — younger, vulnerable, and the emotional anchor; his safety is the line that can’t be crossed.

                <h2>The Story Engine</h2>
                <p>
                    Each episode/chapter forces a choice: food vs morality, speed vs safety, truth vs cohesion. The family’s decisions ripple
                    outward, creating allies, enemies, and consequences that follow them.
                </p>

            <div class="card">
                <h2>Signature Tension</h2>
                <p>
                    A safe place can be worse than the road. A leader can be right and still lose the group. A “good choice” can cost too much.
                    The drama comes from pressure, not plot tricks.

                <p>
                    <strong>Book 1: Ash and Embers</strong> — survival on the road; the family’s bond is tested; the Green Zone becomes the North Star.<br /><br />
                    <strong>Book 2: Children of the Collapse</strong> — the world expands; leadership fractures; new factions form as resources vanish.<br /><br />
                    <strong>Prequel: Flags in the Fire</strong> — the political and social fuse that lit the collapse; the revolution begins.

                <p>
                    Season 1 tracks the family’s journey toward the Green Zone. The world collapses in layers — supply chains, policing, medical care —
                    while the family meets survivors who reflect different responses to collapse: denial, predation, community, fanaticism.
                    The season ends with arrival at the Green Zone… and the unsettling question: <em>safe for who?</em>
